MTGS Mafia Votecounter. Parses a thread and tallies votes. WIP.

Also included are some HTML samples, one of a single post, one of an entire thread page.

TODO:
-Playerlist & Vote validity checks
-Convert Vote list into Vote Count
-UI

Future TODOs:
-When did everyone last post?
-Tally posts made by player each day
-Read for "@MOD" requests
-Player nicknames (to allow more flexibility when voting)
-Save previous votecount & continue from it
-Votecount formatting options.
-Multivoters (uh oh)

ASSUMPTIONS:
Unvotes stand alone (not "unvote:player X")
A player cannot vote and then unvote that vote in the same post (we look for unvotes before vote)
Unvote followed by vote must be in different sets of bold tags
